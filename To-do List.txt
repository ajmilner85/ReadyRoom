Next:
- Update Claude with latest changes
- Refactor FlighData.ts to remove separate structure for lead and lead fuel and unify with flight members, -1 as lead initially
- Add pilot callsign to FlightData.ts
- Sort enroute/tasking and recovery vertical divisions with highest altitudes at the top
- Launch times sorted from bottom to top in order of earliest to latest, removing a lower flight cascades all the others down
- Recovery tanker at lowest slot, empty space between recovery tanker and mission tankers

Essential:
- User editable launch times (Add/Remove/Edit slot)

	- DME distances to holding altitudes and shifts lowest marshal stack altitude to Angels 6
	- Editable Expected Approach Times
	- Next available level calculates expected approach time automatically
- Multiple flights at the same Angels or on the same tanker


QOL:
- Mouse-over board number for pilot callsign
- Fuel state estimate or last update timer
- BRC/Weather Display
- Comms Info
- Altitudes, positions, TACAN, comms for tankers

Cosmetic:
- Second digit of fuel state in smaller font (36 > 32 for low state, 12 > 10 for flight members)

Nice to have:
- Multiple carrier support
- Ability split and merge individual aircraft into and out of flights
- Mission roles
	- Mission commander
