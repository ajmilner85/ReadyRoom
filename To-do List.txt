In Progress:
- .miz import for mission preparation


Next:
- Add utility functions for flight assignment (autofill flights, auto assign / re-assign MIDS channels)
- Mission preparation page
	- Attendance (Discord/Apollo integration?)
		- Cruise, Foothold, Other (Accepted, Declined, Tentative)
		- Training (IP, Trainee, Declined) not needed if IP qualification tracked?
	- Loadouts/Initial Fuel State
	- Create comms card
	- Export kneeboards
- Database implementation
	- Roster
	- Mission/event saving


Essential:
- Altitudes, positions, TACAN, comms for tankers
- Implement light/dark mode


High Priority:
- Squadron Roster Management
	- Implement CRUD functions
		- Prevent duplicate board numbers
	- Role Assignment and Qualification Management
	- Distinguish Site, Discord, and Squadron Roles/Billets

Medium Priority:

	- Split Tanker Column into 2, with divert area at the bottom
- Refactor storage area to sort flights by size (Single > 4-ship)
- Enable dragging-and-dropping to storage area
- Sort storage area flights by callsign then flight number then dash number in ascending order


QOL:
- Add loading indicators
- Add ability to set flight tasking during creation
- Add quick add flight function (e.g. to add an additional STING flight)
- Dragging a flight into an empty area of the En Route/Tasking section brings up an add mission dialog, entering a mission drops the card into that mission division, hitting cancel returns the card to where it was last
- Fuel state estimate or last update timer
- BRC/Weather Display
- Comms Info
- Full ATO info in En Route/Tasking section
- Sort En Route/Tasking to top of page by default
	- Divide by AA and AG taskings?
- Quick references
	- NATOPs
	- NAVAIR
- Simplified, OpenKneeboard compatible dynamic page for live kneeboard updates, last minute coordination


Cosmetic:
- Make storage area into a popup tray?
- Add aircraft icons
- Clean up flight card layout
- Case  II/III recovery section refactor to add
	- Refactor CASE I/II/III button to be a three position sliding toggle

Nice to have:
- Multiple carrier support

- Websocket implementation for real-time collaboration
- Tactical Paddles integration, greenie board

- Mission roles
	- Mission commander
	- Marshall
	- Tower

To prioritize:
- Handle out of action aircraft
- Flag emergency aircraft
- Tagging aircraft with Alibis
- Keybinds, e.g.
	- C - combine flight or check-in
	- R - recover or RTB or Rolex
	- E - established
	- A - approach time
	- W - winchester
	- X - Out of action? Position update?
	- G - gripes/alibis

Complete
- Second digit of fuel state in smaller font (36 > 32 for low state, 12 > 10 for flight members)
