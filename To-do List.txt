In Progress:


Next:
- Refactor storage area to sort flights by size (Single > 4-ship)
- Enable dragging-and-dropping to storage area
- Sort storage area flights by callsign then flight number then dash number in ascending order


Essential:
- Case  II/III toggle that adds
	- Editable Expected Approach Times
	- Next available level calculates expected approach time automatically
	- Refactor CASE I/II/III button to be a three position sliding toggle


High Priority:
- Flight/aircraft creation interface
	- Prevent duplication of board numbers
	- Provide a list of recently used flight callsigns
	- Automatically sequence flight numbers within each callsign
- State saving
- Mission saving
- Position update flight card interaction


Medium Priority:
- Roster
- Attendance and flight assignments
- Import/Export flight assignments
- Assign/import MIDS and encryption channels
- Add signal divert


QOL:
- Dragging a flight into an empty area of the En Route/Tasking section brings up an add mission dialog, entering a mission drops the card into that mission division, hitting cancel returns the card to where it was last
- Fuel state estimate or last update timer
- BRC/Weather Display
- Comms Info
- Altitudes, positions, TACAN, comms for tankers
- Full ATO info in En Route/Tasking section
- Implement light/dark mode
- Sort En Route/Tasking to top of page by default
	- Divide by AA and AG taskings?


Cosmetic:
- Make storage area into a popup tray?
- Add aircraft icons
- Clean up flight card layout

Nice to have:
- Multiple carrier support
- Multiple marshal radials

- Mission roles
	- Mission commander
	- Marshall
	- Tower
	- LSO
- Push, IP, Get Well points for En Route/Tasking Section


To prioritize:
- Handle out of action aircraft
- Flag emergency aircraft
- Tagging aircraft with Alibis
- Keybinds, e.g.
	- C - combine flight or check-in
	- R - recover or RTB
	- A - alibis
	- W - winchester
	- X - Out of action? Position update?

Complete
- Second digit of fuel state in smaller font (36 > 32 for low state, 12 > 10 for flight members)
- Refactor FlighData.ts to remove separate structure for lead and lead fuel and unify with flight members, -1 as lead initially
- Add pilot callsign to FlightData.ts
- Sort enroute/tasking and recovery vertical divisions with highest altitudes at the top
- Launch times sorted from bottom to top in order of earliest to latest
- User editable launch times (Add/Remove/Edit slot)
- User editable tasking and block altitudes (Add/Remove/Edit slot)
	- Altitude block and tasking type
- Fix dragged card going below stationary cards
- User editable tankers (Add/Remove/Edit slot)
- Fix tanker sorting and labels
- Remove add buttons from top of interface, fix add buttons for tanker column
- Fix disappearing flight cards for spin and Charlie buckets
- Hide Edit/Delete/Add buttons from Recovery column for now
- Make edit/delete buttons only appear on moused-over division, left align with container
- Signal Charlie and Spin vertical divisions
- Multiple flights at the same Angels or on the same tanker
- Mouse-over board number for pilot callsign
- Unify add/edit dialog presentations (in progress)
	- Fix edit dialogue popup location (center of browser instead of center of section)
- Fix sorting after updating/editing a vertical division
- Fix edit and delete buttons not fading out after the dialog appears
- Remove add button from Recovery section
- Add confirmation for delete button
- Handle vertical division deletions when they contain flight cards (prevent deleting divisions with flights in them)
- Altitude block OR altitude for En Route/Tasking
- Add a default recovery tanker
- Basic flight card interaction (updating fuel states)
- Add padding between division label and divider line
- Fix alignment of division labels so that cards don't overlap them
- Center align grid layout and storage areas on page
- Background colour for entire page
- Fix drop shadow shading other cards when not being dragged
- Fix spacing between cards in same vertical division, and between different divisions
- Make low fuel states pulse
- Add placeholder three-way toggle for CASE I/II/III
- Add inbound division to top of recovery section
- Vertical navigation bar and placeholder buttons
- Squadron logo
- Keybinds, e.g.
	- S - split flight
	- D - divide flight into sections
- Ability split and merge individual aircraft into and out of flights
	- Issues:
		- Individual flight cards are not the same width as group flight cards
		- Dividing a flight causes the 2nd section to disappear
- Case  II/III toggle that adds
	- DME distances to holding altitudes and shifts lowest marshal stack altitude to Angels 6
